# LessonRoutes — session handoff

Orientation for a fresh Claude Code session picking this project up. Read
`spec.md` (original design) and `README.md` (build status, data sources, known
gotchas) for full detail — this file is the short version plus pointers.

## What this is

An Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MapLibre + OpenFreeMap tiles, Room) for a
NSW driving instructor to record/save/follow custom routes with students, plus a
live map home screen showing hazards, high-traffic-volume roads, school zones,
speed cameras, and a "quiet roads" heuristic — all from free NSW open data. Zero
running cost, no billing account, no login/cloud sync. Package:
`com.instructor.lessonroutes`. Repo: https://github.com/Cozmos94/Driving-App

## Current status (as of this handoff)

Everything in `spec.md` is built in some form. Specifically:

- ✅ **Confirmed working**: map rendering, Room layer, polyline drawing, route
  list/detail navigation, live hazards (incidents + roadworks, tap for info),
  school zones + speed cameras, MapLibre attribution UI tidied up.
- 🔲 **Built but not re-confirmed** after later changes: create route (tap +
  record mode), follow view, edit/delete, notes/tags/waypoints. Worth a test pass.
- ✅ **Phase 2 done**, with two known, documented simplifications (not bugs):
  - High-traffic-volume overlay substitutes for "high-risk roads" (crash data) —
    the real crash dataset was never identified; a Traffic Volume Counts API was
    found and confirmed instead. Both high-volume roads and quiet roads render as
    real painted OpenStreetMap road geometry (snapped via the Overpass API), not
    just markers.
  - Quiet roads (OSM low-traffic proxy) fetch once in a fixed box near wherever
    the device was when the app started — they don't re-query as you pan the map
    elsewhere.
- ✅ Settings screen (minimal — attribution + clear-routes; no fake toggles for
  things this app genuinely has no options for, like map style or units).

## Key files

- `app/src/main/java/com/instructor/lessonroutes/ui/map/RouteMapView.kt` — the
  shared map surface every screen uses. All overlay rendering, tap-hit-testing,
  and MapLibre lifecycle bridging lives here. This file has grown large; read it
  before adding another overlay type.
- `app/src/main/java/com/instructor/lessonroutes/ui/map/LiveMapScreen.kt` — the
  app's home screen (live-following map + all the "ambient" overlays).
- `app/src/main/java/com/instructor/lessonroutes/data/remote/` — `HazardsApi.kt`,
  `TrafficVolumeApi.kt`, `OverpassApi.kt`. All hand-verified against real API
  responses before being built, not guessed at — see README's "Overpass gotchas"
  section before touching these.
- `app/src/main/java/com/instructor/lessonroutes/data/` — Room entities/DAOs.
  Schema is at version 2 with `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` — see README's
  "Database version bump" note before adding another entity.
- `app/src/main/assets/school_zones.json`, `speed_cameras.json` — processed
  static data snapshots (the original ~500MB source shapefile isn't in the repo).

## Environment gotchas (read before debugging something that looks impossible)

- **If building on a Novigi-managed machine**: corporate TLS interception
  (Netskope) breaks Gradle and Android emulator networking in non-obvious ways.
  Full writeup + fixes in `README.md`'s "Corporate network gotcha" section.
- **Overpass API**: client timeout must exceed the query's own `[timeout:N]` —
  got this wrong once already (30s client vs 60s query = silent, confusing
  failures). A plain `[highway]` filter matches footways/cycleways, not just
  roads. See README's "Overpass gotchas" section.
- **`Modifier.weight()`/`.align()` inside Row/Column/Box**: never add an explicit
  import for these — they're member extensions resolved via the scope receiver,
  and an explicit import binds to an unrelated internal symbol instead, causing a
  confusing compile error. Hit this bug twice already this build.
- No Gradle wrapper jar was ever committed — Android Studio generates it on
  first open (Gradle tool window → Tasks → build setup → `wrapper`).

## If you don't have a Transport for NSW API key

Core app (steps 1–8) doesn't need one. Live hazards + traffic volume need
`TFNSW_API_KEY` in `local.properties` (git-ignored, never commit it) — get a free
one from https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au. School zones/cameras (bundled
assets) and quiet roads (OSM only) don't need it.

## Likely next steps

1. Confirm steps 5–8 (create/record/follow/edit/delete) still work after all the
   map-layer changes since they were last tested.
2. If quiet roads should follow the map as you pan (not just show near the start
   location): hook into MapLibre's camera-idle event, debounce, re-fetch.
3. If real crash/black-spot data turns up: same Overpass-snapping approach as
   `TrafficVolumeApi.kt`/`OverpassApi.kt` would apply.
4. A real Room `Migration` (instead of destructive fallback) before this app has
   real user data worth protecting.
